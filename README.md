System Specification for Pack Calculator Application
1. Overview
   
The Pack Calculator application is designed to determine the optimal set of packaging sizes for a given number of items. It consists of a backend service implemented in Golang and a frontend UI implemented in Vue.js. The backend provides an API for calculating packaging, while the frontend offers a user interface for interacting with the API.

2. Requirements
   
2.1 Functional Requirements

User Input: The system shall allow users to input the number of items they need to package.

Packaging Calculation: The system shall calculate the optimal set of packaging sizes for the given number of items.

API Endpoint: The system shall provide an API endpoint to accept item count and return the packaging calculation.

Frontend Interface: The system shall provide a web interface for users to input item count and view the packaging results.

2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The system shall respond to user input within 2 seconds.

Scalability: The system shall be able to handle multiple concurrent users.

Usability: The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to use.

Maintainability: The system shall be modular and easy to update.

Accessibility: The system shall be accessible via the following URLs:

API Endpoint: http://18.135.104.26:8080/api/packs?items=

UI Page: http://18.135.104.26:8080


3. Architecture
   
The application follows a client-server architecture:

Client: The frontend is implemented using Vue.js and provides the user interface.

Server: The backend is implemented using Golang and handles the packaging calculations and serves the API.

4. System Components
   
4.1 Backend (Golang)

Main Application (main.go): Initializes the server, handles routing, and serves static files.

Configuration (config.go): Loads and parses configuration settings.

Pack Calculator Service (packcalculator.go): Contains the logic for calculating the optimal packaging.

Pack Handler (packhandler.go): Handles API requests and responses.

4.2 Frontend (Vue.js)

Main Application (main.js): Initializes the Vue.js application.

App Component (App.vue): Main application component that includes the Pack Calculator component.

Pack Calculator Component (PackCalculator.vue): Provides the user interface for inputting item count and displaying results.


5. Detailed Design
   
5.1 Backend

main.go:
Responsibilities:
Initialize the HTTP server.
Serve static files from the Vue.js build directory.
Handle API requests for packaging calculations.
Logging: Logs incoming requests and responses.

config.go:
Responsibilities:
Load configuration settings (e.g., available pack sizes).

packcalculator.go:
Responsibilities:
Calculate the optimal set of packaging sizes for a given number of items.
Logic:
Iterate through the list of available pack sizes in descending order.
For each pack size, determine the number of packs needed.
If there are remaining items, round up to the nearest available pack size.

packhandler.go:
Responsibilities:
Handle API requests and validate input.
Invoke the pack calculator service.
Return the calculated packaging as a JSON response.

5.2 Frontend

main.js:
Responsibilities:
Initialize the Vue.js application.
Register global dependencies (e.g., Axios for HTTP requests).

App.vue:
Responsibilities:
Serve as the main application container.
Include the Pack Calculator component.

PackCalculator.vue:
Responsibilities:
Provide an input field for the user to enter the number of items.
Display the calculated packaging results.
Handle form submission and make API requests to the backend.
Logging: Logs user interactions and API responses.

6. Data Flow

User Input:
The user inputs the number of items in the frontend form.
The form data is submitted to the Vue.js application.

API Request:
The Vue.js application sends an API request to the Golang backend with the item count.

Packaging Calculation:
The Golang backend validates the input.
The Pack Calculator service calculates the optimal packaging sizes.
The result is logged and returned as a JSON response.

Display Results:
The Vue.js application receives the API response.
The calculated packaging is displayed to the user.

7. Deployment
   
The application can be deployed using Docker and AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). The Docker container includes both the Golang backend and the built Vue.js frontend.

7.1 Deployment URLs

API Endpoint: http://18.135.104.26:8080/api/packs?items=

UI Page: http://18.135.104.26:8080

8. Logging

Backend Logs: Logged using the log package in Golang.
Incoming requests.
API request details.
Calculated packaging results.
User interactions.
API request details.
API responses.

9. Testing
    
9.1 Unit Tests

Backend:

Configuration loader tests (config_test.go).

Pack calculator service tests (packcalculator_test.go).

Pack handler tests (packhandler_test.go).

9.2 Integration Tests

End-to-End Tests: Ensure the entire system works together from user input to API response.

11. Error Handling

Invalid Input: Return an appropriate error message and status code.

Server Errors: Log errors and return a generic error message to the client.

12. Security
    
Input Validation: Ensure all inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.

Conclusion

This system specification outlines the requirements, architecture, components, detailed design, data flow, deployment, logging, testing, error handling, and security considerations for the Pack Calculator application. By following this specification, the application can be developed and maintained effectively, ensuring it meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
